   abstract={In this work we consider a scale-tensor theory in which the space-time is endowed with a Weyl integrable geometrical structure due to the Palatini variational method. Since the scalar field has a geometrical nature (related to non-metricity), the theory is known as \textit{Geometrical Scalar-Tensor}. On the framework of Weyl transformations, a non-minimally coupled scalar-tensor theory on the Jordan frame corresponds to a minimally coupled Einstein-Hilbert action on the Einstein frame. The scalar potential is selected by the Noether symmetry approach in order to obtain conserved quantities for the FRW cosmological model. Exact solutions are obtained and analyzed in the context of the cosmological scenarios consistent with an expanding universe. A particular case is matched in each frame and the role of scalar field as a dark energy component is discussed.}

   abstract={In order to treat quantum cosmology in the framework of Weyl spacetimes we take the first step of extending the Arnowitt-Deser-Misner formalism to Weyl geometry. We then obtain an expression of the curvature tensor in terms of spatial quantities by splitting spacetime in (3+l)-dimensional form. We next write the Lagrangian of the gravitation field based in Weyl-type gravity theory. We extend the general relativistic formalism in such a way that it can be applied to investigate the quantum cosmology of models whose spacetimes are endowed with a Weyl geometrical structure.}

   abstract={We investigate cosmological models in a recently proposed geometrical theory of gravity, in which the scalar field appears as part of the spacetime geometry. We extend the previous theory to include a scalar potential in the action. We solve the vacuum field equations for different choices of the scalar potential and give a detailed analysis of the solutions. We show that, in some cases, a cosmological scenario is found that seems to suggest the appearance of a geometric phase transition. We build a toy model, in which the accelerated expansion of the early Universe is driven by pure geometry.}

   abstract={We investigate quantum cosmological models in an n-dimensional anisotropic universe in the presence of a massless scalar field. Our basic inspiration comes from Chodos and Detweiler’s classical model, which predicts interesting behavior of the extra dimension, shrinking down as time goes by. We work in the framework of a recent geometrical scalar-tensor theory of gravity. Classically, we obtain two distinct types of solutions. One of them has an initial singularity, while the other represents a static universe considered as a whole. By using the canonical approach to quantum cosmology, we investigate how quantum effects could have had an influence in the past history of these universes.}

   abstract={Accelerated light has been demonstrated with laser light and diffraction. Within the diffracting field it is possible to identify a portion that carries most of the beam energy, which propagates in a curved trajectory as it would have been accelerated by a gravitational field for instance. Here, we analyze the effects of this kind of acceleration over the entanglement between twin beams produced in spontaneous parametric down-conversion. Our results show that acceleration does not affect entanglement significantly, under ideal conditions. The optical scheme introduced can be useful in the understanding of processes in the boundary between gravitation and quantum physics.},

We present the new expressions for relativistic momentum and energy for a pointlike particle. To illustrate the new mechanics, we describe the particle motion under a uniform Newtonian gravitational field. We also revisit the free spin-half particle problem in Kleinian spacetime, discuss some quantum implications, like the constraint on the dispersion relation for Weyl fermions, and adapt a metamaterial analog system to Klein spacetime.}
